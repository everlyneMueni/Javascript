Explain declaration in Javascript.
Declaring (creating) javascript variables.When you declare a javascript variable with the var keyword.
After the declaration , the variable has no value(technically it has the value of undefined)

examples:
var x;
var cup;
var cupar;


Explain definition in Javascript.

A function definition consists of the function keyword, followed by:
The name of the function.
A list of parameters to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.

examples:
The following code defines a simple function named square.
function(number){
	return number*number;
}

Explain initialization.
Initialization means assigning an initial value to a variable.
so undefined is the initial value of a declared variable.
var x = 0;

function f() {
  var x = y = 1; // x is declared locally. y is not!
}
f();

console.log(x, y); // Throws a ReferenceError in strict mode (y is not defined). 0, 1 otherwise. 
// In non-strict mode:
// x is the global one as expected
// y leaked outside of the function, though!
