DIFFERENCES BETWEEN UNDEFINED AND NULL IN CONNECTION TO JAVASCRIPT.

Undefined is a variable type whereas null is an object with a value,no properties, is non-mutable and only a single instance
of the same exists in the system at all time.

A major difference between null an undefined is in the way they are converted to primitive types. When you perform arithmetic conversion
on null the value determined is 0.

A variable is said to be undefined if it has been declared but no value has been given to it. contrary to this, null is a value
that can be assigned to a variable and represents no value.
